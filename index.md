# Welcome to MIT MEDG
The Medical Decision Making Group (MEDG) at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science is a research group headed by Prof. Peter Szolovits. We are dedicated to exploring and furthering the application of technology and artificial intelligence to clinical situations.

## People

Our group members are working on a range of projects. 

### Ph.D.
